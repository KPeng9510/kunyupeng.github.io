I'm Dr.-Ing. Kunyu Peng, a postdoctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I work at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and human-centered AI. I received my B.Sc. degree in Automation from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), and received my M.Sc degree and doctoral degree from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2021 and 2024, respectively. 
My academic journey is shaped by strong interdisciplinary projects, including elderly activity recognition, industrial assistance systems, and human cognitive status estimation, supported by institutions such as the German Research Foundation and the Carl-Zeiss-Foundation. My research focuses on deep learning based video understanding, human activity recognition, vision language models, and scene perception.
